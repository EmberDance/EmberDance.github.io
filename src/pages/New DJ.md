# DJ Guidelines

Ember Blues and Fusion is a social dance. We value diversity in the music presented.

## Be Prepared:

DJ’s must have music downloaded to their devices and be able to work “off line”. (Spotify allows you to download playlists.) You must arrive at least 15 minutes before first set, or 30 minutes before second set.

## Be Active:

You must be an active DJ. Read the crowd and energy level. Adjust and reorder your playlist as necessary to adapt to the floor and the crowd. That does not mean you necessarily have to reorder a playlist, but you must be prepared to. You do not have to take requests if you do not want to.

## Broad Musical Formatting:

DJ's should play a wide variety of music that covers the spectrum from "Totally Blues" (E.g. Howlin' Wolf) to "Totally Fusion" (E.g. Massive Attack). You should aim to format your sets as roughly half "Blues Event" format and roughly half "Fusion Event" format.

Many guests will prefer a more “Blues” format and many will prefer a more “Fusion” format. Aim to play a selection that everyone is happy with about 2/3 of your playlist. Allowing outliers that the people who enjoy the more polarizing ends of the spectrum have opportunities for that.


The majority of music played should be danceable with a 2-step basic blues dance like what beginners will be taught in their intro lesson. You are strongly encouraged to be aware of the intermediate progressive lesson subject, and incorporate songs that complement that. You may include a couple of “challenge” songs that are based in other rhythms like merengue, polka, or salsa.

## Language and Content

Curse words are generally fine. Racial slurs are not generally appropriate.

Be aware of and use best judgment regarding lyrical subject matter of songs. Much of the music being played deals with topics of violence, racism, and other potentially sensitive subjects. Be respectful and considerate of the art and the audience. If you are unsure of a song, check with an organizer or an experienced DJ. If you’re not sure if a song is appropriate, it probably isn’t.
