# **Safe Spaces Policy**

Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to create an environment where all participants feel safe, respected, and supported, regardless of their background, gender, race, sexuality, ability, or any other aspect of their identity. We are committed to fostering an inclusive space for everyone to enjoy the art of blues and fusion dancing, free from harassment, discrimination, or harm.  
1\. Respect and Consent:

* Consent is key. Always ask for and receive clear consent before initiating any physical contact during dances. This includes but is not limited to leads, follows, and all social interactions. With a dance this may be as little as a gesture and a nod, but for more intimate aspects like close embrace or dips you should get verbal consent before continuing.  
* Always respect boundaries. If someone communicates their discomfort or asks you to stop, you must do so immediately without question.  
* Be mindful of verbal and non-verbal cues that may indicate discomfort.

2\. Zero Tolerance for Harassment:

* Harassment of any kind—whether physical, verbal, or emotional—is strictly prohibited. This includes inappropriate comments, jokes, or actions that target someone's identity.  
* Harassment also includes unwanted physical touch or inappropriate advances. If you experience or witness harassment, please report it to the organizers immediately.

3\. Inclusivity:

* We encourage diversity and inclusion. Our scene welcomes individuals from all walks of life, including but not limited to different races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, and backgrounds.  
* Language, music, and behavior should reflect an understanding and respect for diversity.

4\. Accessibility:

* We strive to make our events accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. If you have specific accessibility needs, please contact the organizers in advance, and we will do our best to accommodate you.  
* For individuals who are immuno-suppressed or have other health concerns, we recognize the importance of maintaining a safe environment. In addition to general safety measures, we will occasionally hold masked dance events where mask-wearing will be required for all participants to help create a safer space for those with weakened immune systems.  
* We encourage everyone to be mindful and supportive of others' health needs. If you are feeling unwell or have concerns about your health, please consider participating in a way that respects your own needs and the needs of others.  
* We will work to ensure that our venues and events are as accessible as possible, whether that involves specific seating arrangements, accessibility for mobility devices, or other accommodations.

5\. Reporting and Accountability:

* If you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or have witnessed behavior that violates this policy, please report it to one of the event organizers or designated safety officers.  
* All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly. We are committed to maintaining confidentiality to the extent possible while ensuring that the issue is addressed.  
* Depending on the nature and severity of the incident, appropriate actions will be taken, including but not limited to warnings, removal from events, or permanent bans from the community.

6\. Healthy Communication:

* Open and respectful communication is encouraged. This includes being mindful of personal space, tone, and the language we use.  
* If you're unsure about something, it's better to ask than to assume.

7\. Dance Etiquette:

* Everyone has the right to enjoy the music and dance in a way that feels comfortable. Respect for each other’s dance style and creative expression is crucial.  
* Avoid dominating or monopolizing any one partner for an extended period if others seem interested in dancing, and be mindful of space when dancing in a group setting. Lifts and aerials are considered off limits. If there are few to no active dancers on the floor lifts may be permissible, but aerials should always be avoided.

8\. Participation:

* Our scene is built on mutual respect and enjoyment. Participation is encouraged, but you are never required to dance with anyone or in any way that makes you uncomfortable.  
* We respect each individual’s right to enjoy the dance scene in a way that works best for them.

Conclusion: By participating in our blues and fusion dance events, you agree to uphold the principles of this policy and work towards creating a supportive, inclusive, and respectful environment for all. We believe that a thriving dance scene is one where everyone feels welcome and valued. Thank you for contributing to a positive and safe space for all dancers.
